# Terminal Emulators

## Terminal.app

Native macOS terminal with excellent session restoration - previous sessions are
automatically restored after reboot, preserving your working context.

## kitty

Subjectively still faster than Ghostty. Shines with its minimalist UI where tabs
are rendered as part of a single unified line, making the entire window feel
like a pure terminal console experience without separate UI chrome. Supports
desktop notifications.

## Ghostty

Currently the terminal of choice for its macOS-leaning UI and very fast
Quake-style terminal. Supports desktop notifications.
