## Manual configuration

* Cleaned up GarageBand and other non-used non-default apps
* Logged in to Apple ID
  * Disable all iCloud toggles
* Enabled FileVault
* Configured syncthing to use default dir as /Volume/[StorageName]
* Enabled remote login -- this was enabled by `services.openssh.enable = true`
  * Enabled allow full disk access for remote users under `Remote Login`
* Enabled Screen Sharing
* Disabled for now: Enabled remote management, can't enable it using any automation clearly
  (https://www.reddit.com/r/macsysadmin/comments/13dhnmb/enable_remote_management_through_shell_script/?rdt=53927)
* Enabled file sharing
  * Added `/Volume/[StorageName]` to shared folders
  * Enable full disk access for all users, otherwise you can't have access,
    automation can't do it for now or by design?
  * Need to grant all different service with access to disk, namely:
    * Syncthing?
    * watchman / make ?
* Enable auto login in System Settings
* Remove `noauto` from /etc/fstab for /nix store, having issues with launchd
  services that can't be started due to /nix mount point not mounted yet:

  * Seems like noauto still did not help
  * This was resolved by using /bin/wait4path utility already used in command
    directive in launchd nix-darwin module and for own modules that using
    external volume we added it to custom scripts
* Disabled encryption/FileVault to be able to autologin
  * Also faced at least once that system wanted to unlock encrypted /nix store
    volume, which it turns out determinate encrypts by defaults and writes key to
    system keychain
  * Decrypted /nix store to avoid issue above:
    ```console
    sudo diskutil apfs decryptVolume disk3s7
    ```

On other machines:

```console
ssh-copy-id ivan@192.168.50.46
```

## Upgrade notes

### `post-build` script hanged

```console
sudo vim /nix/var/determinate/post-build-hook.sh
# Place exit 0 at the top of the file
```

### Full Disk access / Removable disk

On boot tmux rebuild service can't get access to /Volumes/Storage

Still an issue.

## TODO

- [ ] Add /Volumes/Storage to /etc/fstab
