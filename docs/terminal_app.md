# Terminal.app Configuration

- Change default profile to Basic
- Set font to Hack Nerd Font / Regular / 13
- Close window if shell exits cleanly
- Set Option key as Meta (Profiles → Keyboard → Use Option as Meta key)

## Notes

- **Background color**: Avoid setting background color manually
as it breaks automatic dark/light mode switching.

<!-- TODO: Figure out how to switch Terminal.app's new macOS 26 themes for dark/light mode -->
