## Disk

Setting swap to 8G.

## TPM2

### Enrolling TPM2 (if available)

The a3 system uses a single LUKS-encrypted partition that contains an LVM volume group with separate logical volumes for root and swap. You only need to enroll TPM2 for this single encrypted partition:

```console
# Enroll TPM2 for the encrypted partition containing both root and swap
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto /dev/disk/by-uuid/b63f3e81-c6d5-4dc6-af60-f5eef6c79af9
```

After enrolling TPM2, the system should unlock automatically during boot without requiring a passphrase.
