# a3

## Disk

Setting swap to 8G.

## TPM2

### Enrolling TPM2 (if available)

The a3 system uses a single LUKS-encrypted partition that contains an LVM volume group with separate logical volumes for root and swap. You only need to enroll TPM2 for this single encrypted partition:

```console
# Enroll TPM2 for the encrypted partition containing both root and swap
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --tpm2-device=auto /dev/disk/by-uuid/e2e28bab-53df-4636-ad2e-20235d4101b9
```

After enrolling TPM2, the system should unlock automatically during boot without requiring a passphrase.

## Boot

Boot timeout is set to 1 second to allow access to previous generations while keeping boot fast.

## Network

DHCP lease configured for static IP address 192.168.50.6.

## KDE Wallet + GPG Integration

To enable GPG passphrase storage in KDE Wallet:

1. **Required package**: `kwalletcli` must be installed - this provides `pinentry-kwallet`
2. **GPG agent config**: Set `pinentry-program` to use `pinentry-kwallet`
3. **KDE Wallet password**: Must match your login password for auto-unlock

Without `kwalletcli`, the GPG pinentry dialog won't show the "Save in password manager" option.
