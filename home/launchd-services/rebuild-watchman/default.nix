# Watchman service for automatic darwin-rebuild
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES AND CAVEATS:
#
# 1. Permission Issues:
#    - Requires Full Disk Access permission in System Settings
#    - May need manual approval in Privacy & Security settings
#    - Uses ProcessType = "Interactive" and AbandonProcessGroup = true to help with permissions
#
# 2. Sudo Handling:
#    - Uses SUDO_ASKPASS to handle privilege escalation non-interactively
#    - Doesn't run entire command as sudo (security best practice)
#    - Let's darwin-rebuild handle its own privilege escalation
#
# 3. Output Handling:
#    - All output is redirected to log files (not visible in terminal)
#    - Check logs at:
#      /tmp/log/launchd/rebuild-watchman.log
#      /tmp/log/launchd/rebuild-watchman.error.log
#
# 4. Known Limitations:
#    - May still encounter permission issues with certain system operations
#    - Requires careful security consideration (running with elevated privileges)
#    - May need manual intervention for some security-sensitive operations
#    - osascript notifications don't work properly in launchd context
#      (notifications about success/failure may not appear)
#
# Alternative Approaches Considered:
# - Running as root (rejected for security reasons)
# - Using sudoers configuration (more complex, requires system changes)
# - Creating a privileged helper tool (most proper but complex solution)
