# We can clean it up combining two commands:
#
# 1.
#
# ```console
# ❯ home-manager generations
# 2023-10-18 12:39 : id 1163 -> /nix/store/jhnjszgsni1a94aff7f31jj3hzg7n757-home-manager-generation
# ...
# 2023-10-12 19:20 : id 1144 -> /nix/store/44la87nfymkvczy6lnfjz8i78r9d6fgc-home-manager-generation
#
# for g in {1144..1162};do home-manager remove-generations $g;done
# ```
#
# 2.
#
# ```console
# nix-collect-garbage -d
# ```
#
# nix gc is the second command, because it will clean it up home-manager
# generations once we delete them.
